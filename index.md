#SPIRL

Hi! Welcome to the **Security and Privacy Interactions Research Lab (SPIRL)** at Carleton University. At SPIRL, we conduct research in usable security: the intersection of computer security and human-computer interaction (HCI). In general, we are interested in how security technologies can be designed to take into account usersâ€™ abilities and limitations, and how we can more effectively protect users while asking them to do less. Our research interests include passwords and authentication (graphical passwords, password managers, password coping strategies), culture and security, and computer security education, among others!

SPIRL is directed by Elizabeth Stobert, assistant professor in the [School of Computer Science](https://scs.carleton.ca) and co-director of the [HCI Masters program](https://carleton.ca/hci/) at [Carleton University](https://www.carleton.ca). We are always looking for talented students who would like to do research in the area of HCI and security. Please feel free to get in touch if you're interested in working with us!
