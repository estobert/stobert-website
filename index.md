Hi! I’m a researcher in human-computer interaction (HCI) and in particular, usable security. I’m interested in how psychological research can be applied to the design of security systems. My research projects in usable security have included projects on two-factor authentication, graphical passwords, password managers, password coping strategies, location-based server authentication, and computer security education. More generally, I am interested in how security technologies can be designed to take into account users’ abilities and limitations, and how we can more effectively protect users while asking them to do less.

I am an assistant professor in the [School of Computer Science](https://scs.carleton.ca) and the [HCI Masters program](https://carleton.ca/hci/) at [Carleton University](https://www.carleton.ca). I am always looking for talented students who would like to research in the area of HCI and security. Please feel free to get in touch if you're interested in working with me.
