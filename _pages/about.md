Hi! I’m a researcher in human-computer interaction (HCI) and in particular, usable security. I’m interested in how psychological research can be applied to the design of security systems. My research projects in usable security have included projects on two-factor authentication, graphical passwords, password managers, password coping strategies, location-based server authentication, and computer security education. More generally, I am interested in how security technologies can be designed to take into account users’ abilities and limitations, and how we can more effectively protect users while asking them to do less.

As of January 2018, I’m working as a researcher at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, supported by an NSERC PDF. I’m currently looking for usable security collaborations in the Montreal area, if you’re interested please send me email!

Until July 2017, I was a post-doctoral researcher working with Srdjan Capkun in the System Security group at ETH Zürich. I worked on projects examining usability aspects and human factors in location-based authentication, two-factor authentication, and computer security education.

I was previously a student at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. In 2015, I completed my PhD in computer science, working with Robert Biddle, and the Hotsoft lab. My PhD thesis investigated how focusing on users’ existing abilities and habits can help improve the security and usability of authentication processes. I also have an MA in psychology from Carleton.
