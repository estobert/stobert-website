### Organization

I'm the PC co-chair of NSPW 2020. [NSPW 2020](http://www.nspw.org) will be held in North Conway, New Hampshire, USA from October 26 - 29. We are in search of embryonic, disruptive, and unconventional ideas on information and cyber security that benefit from early feedback. Additionally, in 2020 we are inviting theme submissions around “Automated Reasoning for Security”. Please consider submitting - NSPW is a wonderful venue for feedback and discussion.

I’m the co-organizer and co-founder of [Who are you?!: The Adventures in Authentication (WAY) Workshop](http://way-workshop.org). WAY has run in 2014, 2016 -- 2020 as part of the SOUPS conference, and we are proud that WAY is a supportive venue for providing feedback on emerging work in usable authentication. Papers are due May 28, 2020 - please consider submitting!
