### Organization

I'm the PC co-chair of NSPW 2019. [NSPW 2019](http://www.nspw.org) will be held in San Carlos, Costa Rica from September 23 - 26. We are in search of embryonic, disruptive, and unconventional ideas on information and cyber security that benefit from early feedback. Additionally, in 2019 we are inviting theme submissions around “Social manipulation through technology”. 

I’m the co-organizer and co-founder of [Who are you?!: The Adventures in Authentication (WAY) Workshop](http://way-workshop.org). WAY has run in 2014, 2016 -- 2018 as part of the SOUPS conference, and we are proud that WAY is a supportive venue for providing feedback on emerging work in usable authentication.
