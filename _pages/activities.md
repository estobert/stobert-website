### Teaching

In Fall 2017, I taught HCIN 5100: Fundamentals of HCI Design and Evaluation at Carleton University. The course explored how fundamental research in psychology affects the design of computer interfaces. 

### Organization

Iâ€™m the co-organizer and co-founder of Who are you?!: The Adventures in Authentication (WAY) Workshop. WAY has run in 2014, 2016, and 2017 as part of the SOUPS conference, and we are proud that WAY is a supportive venue for providing feedback on emerging work in usable authentication.

Update: WAY will once again take place as part of the SOUPS 2018 conference. Stay tuned for more details, and we hope you'll consider submitting!
