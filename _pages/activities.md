# Teaching

In Fall 2017, I’m teaching HCIN 5100: Fundamentals of HCI Design and Evaluation at Carleton University.

# Organization

I’m the co-organizer and co-founder of the Who are you?!: The Adventures in Authentication (WAY) Workshop. WAY has run in 2014, 2016, and 2017 as part of the SOUPS conference, and we are proud that WAY is a supportive venue for giving feedback on emerging work in usable authentication.

# Program Committees

EURO S&P 2018
STAST 2017
CANS 2017
NSPW 2017
SOUPS 2017
